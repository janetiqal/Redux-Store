# Redux-Store
Refactoring an e-commerce website to use Redux instead of React's Context API.

## Description

This was a fully functional application that allowed users to add items to their cart and checkout using Stripe Payment platform (in test mode), sign in and sign up. It was built using a MERN stack. It was my job to implement redux instead of using react's context api for global state. 

## Technologies
React.js, Node.js Redux, Apollo Server, GraphQL, MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Usage
Fork this repository, and clone it to a repository and run locally after running npm i to install dependencies, npm run develop launches the application at local host.
